# ClaimWise-AI
this repository for the recording of ClaimWise-AI made for the competition of Bajaj Hackrx 2025

ClaimWise AI is a sophisticated Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system engineered to streamline and enhance the process of insurance claim analysis. This solution automates the interpretation of complex policy documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT), providing rapid, accurate, and justified claim decisions (Approved, Rejected, Insufficient Information).

 ClaimWise AI integrates with Ollama, leveraging a customized llama3.2 Large Language Model. This customization was achieved through an Ollama Modelfile, which allowed for the permanent embedding of a detailed system prompt. This unique approach ensures that the LLM consistently adheres to a predefined, rule-based analytical framework for every claim, providing precise justifications directly referencing policy clauses without requiring repetitive prompt injection from the application layer

 #NOTE: The actual "insurance-analyst" model version LLM is not posted in this repository but files to create it are posted
